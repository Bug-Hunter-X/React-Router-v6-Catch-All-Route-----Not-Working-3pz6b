# React Router v6 Catch-All Route Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the catch-all route ('*') in React Router v6.  The problem is that the catch-all route does not function correctly, failing to handle unmatched routes.

The `App.js` file contains the buggy code. `AppSolution.js` provides a corrected version that addresses the issue.
